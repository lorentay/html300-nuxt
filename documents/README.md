# Search Engine Optimization (SEO)
You can use keywords to optimize how a search engine locates and ranks your website. This is called search engine optimization (SEO). Keywords describe the content of your website. Ultimately, you want your website to appear near the top of a search so a user can find it. 

# Analytics
Analytics programs, like [Google Analytics](https://support.google.com/analytics/topic/14089939?hl=en&ref_topic=14090456&sjid=9984887697429747053-NC), can track the traffic on your site and tell you if your keywords are working. For example, if a user clicks your website in a web search, you can determine how long a user stays on a page. You want content that will keep the user on the page for as long as posssible. If a user clicks away from a page immediately, it may indicate that the content isn't beneficial.
 
# Plan of Ideal SEO Implementation
**Add Rich Content**: Although my site doesn't have a lot of content right now, I would focus on adding engaging material around topics like creating a beautiful garden, making cocktails, and entertaining ideas. Each recipe and garden feature would have detailed descriptions, using keywordsâ€”for example, "garden design tips," "how to plant beautiful containers," and "cocktail recipes for entertaining."

**Add Relevant Backlinks**: I would add relevant backlinks from reputable gardening websites, key entertaining resources, and cocktail recipe websites. This would improve my site's ranking in search results by increasing its authority.

**Evaluate Analytics**: I would use an analytics tool like Google Analytics to analyze where users spend the most time on my site and where they click away. Based on this data, I would modify the content, which could involve regularly updating the site with new content, adding more relevant backlinks, or modifying the layout for a better user experience.
