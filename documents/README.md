# Search Engine Optimization (SEO)
You can use keywords to optimize how a search engine locates and ranks your website. This is called search engine optimization (SEO). Keywords describe the content of your website. Ultimately, you want your website to appear near the top of a search so a user can find it. 

# Analytics
Analytics programs, like [Google Analytics](https://support.google.com/analytics/topic/14089939?hl=en&ref_topic=14090456&sjid=9984887697429747053-NC), can track the traffic on your site and tell you if your keywords are working. For example, if a user clicks your website in a web search, you can determine how long a user stays on a page. Your goal is to create rich content that will keep a user on the page and engage with the content. If a user clicks away from a page immediately, it may indicate that the content isn't beneficial.
